# exchange-socket
Multi Crypto Exchange Feed in Node

In progress

Idea is to have a single source of all information for different exchanges/products.

First as a standalone server, then maybe a client library that can connect to a hosted instance.


- Currently supports basic gdax and bittrex
- to use run npm install then npm start.
- express server should boot up and allow connections
